<h1 align="center">Well hey, I'm Naomi! <img src="https://media.tenor.com/e3GqicbfhMYAAAAi/get-greeting-get-greetings.gif" alt="waving face" width="30px"></h1>

I'm a passionate advocate for females in male dominated industries, and empowering minorities 🙌🏽

One of the proud recipients of the 2023 Diversity Scholarship with Coder Academy for a Diploma of IT, I'm currently on my way to becoming a graduate full stack developer. It's been a juggle studying whilst working this year, but I've managed to average HD's across the board and I'm excited to dive further into the web dev world 🌏

I can also fly helicopters and legally marry people in Australia, as well as having completed the Pacific Crest Trail, the Kokoda Track, and the Camino de Santiago... 

So, yes, I'm tenacious, I'm driven, I'm a people person, and I love a challenge!

### I'm all about community, so we can connect here:
